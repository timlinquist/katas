# Given the a Yaml file of the format found in music.yaml parse the file so that we can access it in Ruby.
# 
# Your parsing code should return an object that allows you to access attributes using the [] operator:
# 
#     data["genres"].last["artists"].first["albums"].first["tracks"].last["name"] => "But Not For Me"
# 
# The returned object should also allow you to access attributes using method calls:
# 
#     data.genres.last.artists.first.albums.first.tracks.last.name => "But Not For Me"
